It was honestly one of the greatest interview experiences I’ve ever had. I had a great time learning about your backgrounds, interests and your day-to-day at 160over90. You truly seem like a smart, fun and creative group to work with.</p><p</p>
<p id="affb2798-7c1a-4f6e-a8f0-327adfec5ea9" class="">I really appreciated you sharing details about the projects and clients you enjoy working on, from higher education and financial services, and your honesty about the culture, organization and values of the team. I would love the opportunity to work with you, whether that’s at 160over90 or anything down the line if this doesn’t work out.</p>
